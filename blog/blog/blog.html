							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>
								This blog covers my first-year project for computer
								science challenges at Queen's University Belfast. This module pushes you
								to learn and produce a project using technology you have
								never used before challenging you to go out of your comfort zone in
								learning new technologies and to solve problems you have never solved
								before. For this module I was assigned the Structures project as a part of
								my topic choice of robotics and manufacturing because I have a personal interest in this area.
							</p>
							<p>
								<u><strong>Project Objective:</strong></u>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Model cheaply purchasable components e.g., 2x4 planks, nuts, and bolts
									and create them in three.js/bullet with appropriate physics properties,
									including weight, friction. Objects should include costs and links for
									purchase.
								</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Create models of physical parts with appropriate bending, twisting and
									breaking effects (a model that they can occur) so that structures of
									suitable strength can be developed and limitations under forces can be
									incorporated into the design of machines.
								</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>
									Creating models of physical attachments e.g. nuts and bolts, nails,
									glue, etc. that have parameters and can replicate plausible behaviors
									when subject to physical forces within a physics engine (including
									vibration)
								</strong>
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>
								<u>Three.js and ammo.js</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								To carry out this task I was assigned to use three.js and ammo.js; both
								JavaScript libraries; Three.js is used to create 3d graphics in a web
								browser and ammo.js to create a physics world these two libraries can be
								used in conjunction to display bodies I want to simulate and show how they
								are affected by physics in the physics world I create. This task was
								overwhelming at first for me as I was not only new to physics and graphics
								engines but also, I had never used JavaScript and have no background in
								robotics and manufacturing, So as a prerequisite I had to learn this
								JavaScript. To learn this language I followed a YouTube series created by a
								popular YouTube called mosh
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk">
									https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk
								</a>
								, This tutorial not only got me set up on the basics of JavaScript like for
								loops if statements and creating objects. I picked up the language quickly
								because of my experience in other programming languages like C# and java
								which have similarities to JavaScript and through the sample projects I was
								implementing to learn both the libraries for this project. however, I found
								out during the duration of my project the JavaScript is a little harder
								than showed in the tutorial due to some of the basic functions that other
								languages had built in which I had to implement myself like 2d arrays this
								tutorial also introduced me to the IDE I would be using for the duration of
								the project visual studio code. I had never really used this ide before, so
								I also had to do some tutorials learning it as well it was not that hard,
								and I have ended up with visual studio code being one of my favourite ides.
								After getting comfortable with both JavaScript and visual studio code I had
								to move onto the next step learning three.js luckily three.js is a widely
							used library with many examples and tutorials (    <a href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a> ) which I made use
								of. For me I have a preference for learning from YouTube tutorials so I
								found (
								<a
									href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKzyhcyAijo&amp;list=PLRtjMdoYXLf6mvjCmrltvsD0j12ZQDMfE"
								>
									https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKzyhcyAijo&amp;list=PLRtjMdoYXLf6mvjCmrltvsD0j12ZQDMfE
								</a>
								) this library was easy to get used to for this reasons I created some
								examples like creating blocks and so on. The next step I then moved on
								learning the ammo.js library the issue I found with ammo.js is that unlike
								three.js there is hardly any documentation examples and tutorials to use I
								struggled at first and found it overwhelming but through my searching, I
								found a good tutorial which covered the basic well of ammo.js constraints,
								objects, collision detection, and filtering.
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Three.js</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Getting started with ammo.js.</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								Before starting to add object and cool stuff you need to first define the
								physics world in all of the sample projects this was the main similarity
								which I done in all.
							</p>
							<p>
								At first looking at examples of ammo.js projects and how they create the
								world the statements made no sense to me at all as I could not understand
								what the statements function calls for this creating the world function
								were doing. It took a while to get a grasp on what was happening but
								luckily you have me to explain these concepts and save you from the pain I
								dealt with trying to figure out what they did.
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Ammo.js concepts</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								During my learning experience I covered some basic concepts of ammo.js in
								sequential order. These concepts that I put into practice at the start of
								my project through the use of some sample projects ended up becoming
								fundamental for the development of my structures project, I am going to go
								over the ammo.js concepts I learned using some sample projects I created
								which you can access through this github link: (
								<a href="https://github.com/Ryan-McKee2001/three.js-ammo.js-blog-examples">
									https://github.com/Ryan-McKee2001/three.js-ammo.js-blog-examples
								</a>
								) you can take and use to help you get started using and understanding
								ammo.js and follow along with my all my code is commented out in addition
								to the information in the blog so hopefully it should help you a lot with
								getting started using ammo.js. The projects I have created so far mainly
								focused on four main concepts:
							</p>
							<p>
								- Rigid bodies
							</p>
							<p>
								- Soft bodies
							</p>
							<p>
								- Collision detection and filtering
							</p>
							<p>
								- Constraints
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Rigid bodies</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								Bodies in ammo.js are called collision objects or more commonly rigid
								bodies. Rigid bodies are the objects in the simulation which move, collide
								has mass and can have impulses applied to it.<u></u>
							</p>
							<p>
								There are three types of rigid bodies and many-body shapes can be
								implemented in ammo.js. The three types of ammo.js bodies are:
							</p>
							<p>
								- <u>Static Rigid bodies</u> – These bodies have a fixed position
								throughout the physics simulation and cannot be moved.
							</p>
							<p>
								- <u>Kinematic Rigid bodies</u> – These bodies are not affected by the
								physics of the Ammo.js world but are can be animated during the physics
								simulation.
							</p>
							<p>
								- <u>Dynamic rigid bodies</u> – These are the most intensive rigid body
								type in ammo.js, these bodies are fully affected by the physics of the
								world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now we will show examples of each of these body types in code and how they
								work.
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Static rigid bodies</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								Static rigid bodies are defined similarly to how we would define a dynamic
								or Kinematic rigid-body the difference when creating this body is that we
								set the mass to 0, This makes the body unmovable in the simulation and
								therefore static as well, Because it is static we do not need to add it to
								the rigid bodies array we typically define at the start of the script as we
								will not be moving this object throughout the physics simulation so we will
								not need to update the three.js representation of this static body in the
								animation loop. In this example we create a static body as a cube object
								which will be used as the plane for the world to be based.
							</p>
							<p>
								<u>Kinematic Rigid bodies</u>
							</p>
							<p>
								This body has a mass of 0 however, we add it to the rigid bodies array as
								we will be updating its position in the physics world thus also updating
								the three.js representation in the render loop function. For this example,
								I animated the body by just changing its z position by +0.03 for 10 frames
								then updating the blocks position by +0.03 on the x for another 10 frames
								repeating this process but with -0.03 for 10 frames on the z and x
								positions. There are many other things you could do like animate the block
								when a key is pressed by the user and so on, but I will not be covering
								that here.
							</p>
							<p>
								Dynamic Rigid bodies
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the dynamic body of the program which the other two types of rigid
								body are based on, In this example, I set the mass of the rigid body to be
								1 therefore this object will be affected by the ammo.js physics world. I
								also added this object to the rigid bodies array
