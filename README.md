# CompSciChallangesProject
This is my Computer science challanges project on Robotics and manufacturing: structures 

The objective of this project is to:
- Model cheaply purchasable components e.g., 2x4 planks, nuts and bolts and create them in three.js/bullet with appropriate physics properties, including weight, friction. Objects should include costs and links for purchase.
- Create models of physical parts with appropriate bending, twisting and breaking effects (model that they can occur) so that structures of suitable strength can be developed and limitations under forces can be incorporated into the design of machines.
- Create models of physical attachments e.g. nuts and bolts, nails, glue etc. that have parameters and can replicate plausible behaviours when subject to physical forces within a physics engine (including vibration)

For this project I will be using the javascript libraries three.js/ammo.js.
