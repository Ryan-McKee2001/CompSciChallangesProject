						<strong><u>Getting started with three.js and ammo.js</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Welcome to my guide on ammo.js and three.js this guide aims to give you the
						knowledge on the fundamentals of using these libraries and act as a Lego
						kit of sorts for building your projects.
					</strong></p>
					<p>
						<strong><u>What are three.js and ammo.js?</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Ammo and three.js are both JavaScript libraries, three.js is a graphics
						engine that allows you to create and display animated 2d graphics in a web
						browser using WebGL, this is a great library with many users and great
						projects supporting it so it is not hard to learn these resources include
					the three.js website    <a target="_blank" href="https://threejs.org/">https://threejs.org/</a>
						which contains several examples of what can be done with the library and
						has documentation explaining all the code and what it does. Ammo.js is a
						physics engine that allows you to create a physics world that can be used
						in conjunction with a graphics engine to create graphical physics
						simulations. This library is a port of the popular c and c++ bullet physics
						engine therefore it is a niche library with very few guides and project
						using it, that is why this guide exists, I am to show you how to use this
						engine.
					</strong></p>
					<p>
						<strong>
								There is 4 main part of ammo.js concepts that you should be aware
								of to get used of this engine these are:
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						- Rigid bodies
					</p>
					<p>
						- Soft bodies
					</p>
					<p>
						- Collision detection and filtering
					</p>
					<p>
						- Constraints
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Rigid bodies</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Bodies in ammo.js are called collision objects or more commonly rigid
						bodies. Rigid bodies are the objects in the simulation which move, collide,
						and have mass, and can have impulses applied to them.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/rigidBodyExample.png.crdownload" alt="" /></a>
					<p><strong>
						There are three types of rigid bodies and many-body shapes can be
						implemented in ammo.js. The three types of ammo.js bodies are:
					</strong></p>
					<p><strong>
						- Static Rigid bodies – These bodies have a fixed position throughout the
						physics simulation and cannot be moved when defining these bodies they have
						a mass of 0 applied to them.
					</strong></p>
					<p><strong>
						- Kinematic Rigid bodies – These bodies are not affected by the physics of
						the Ammo.js world but are can be animated during the physics simulation,
						These bodies are similar to the static rigid bodies in that they have a
						mass of 0, but unlike the static rigid bodies we add the bodies to the
						rigid bodies array we typically define globally at the start of our program
						script to allow the positions of it and its three.js counterpart to be
						changed in the worlds as it is animated.
					</strong></p>
					<p><strong>
						- Dynamic rigid bodies – These are the most intensive rigid body type in
						ammo.js, these bodies are fully affected by the physics of the world.
					</strong></p>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Soft bodies</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Soft bodies are defined as bodies in computer graphics that visually and
						realistically represent the motion and properties of deformable objects
						while being able to some extent retain their shape, these bodies can
						represent real-life objects balloons, or clothes.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/softBodiesExampleImage.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Constraints</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Constraints can be thought of as joints that would be used in real life to
						connect multiple objects. There are multiple types of constraints in
						ammo.js to carry out different functions:
					</strong></p>
					<p>
						<u>Point–to–point constraints.</u>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Point to point constraints limits the translation of two pivot points of
						rigid bodies to match the world space. Using this constraint, you can
						create a chain of rigid bodies. This constraint can be useful for creating
						something like a robotic arm or in the case of my structures project a
						plank of wood using several rigid bodies in columns and rows.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/p2pconstraint example.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<u>Hinge constraints</u>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Hinge constraints are joints that restrict rotation around the pivot of two
						bodies to only one axis, therefore this axis could be useful for creating
						something like a door. Or even flaps on an airplane model as this
						constraint also allows the user to specify the limits and motor of the
						hinge.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/hinge constraint example.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<u>Slider constraint</u>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						The slider constraint allows a body to rotate around one axis and translate
						along that axis. This constraint would be useful for creating something
						like a piston.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/slider constraint example.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<u>Cone twist constraints</u>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						This cone constraint is a special version of the point-to-point constraint
						that adds cone and twist axis limits. The axis for this constraint serves
						as a twist axis. This constraint is useful for creating something like a
						ragdoll.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/cone constraint example.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Collision detection</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						Collision detection in ammo.js is a concept that allows for the collision
						and interaction between objects, four main concepts aid with collision
						detection which allows you to show how objects interact in a world:
					</strong></p>
					<p>
						- Contact Manifold check
					</p>
					<p>
						- Contact test
					</p>
					<p>
						- Contact pair test
					</p>
					<p>
						- Ghost objects
					</p>
					<p><strong>
						To understand each of these I suggest you check out this tutorial:
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://medium.com/@bluemagnificent/collision-detection-in-javascript-3d-physics-using-ammo-js-and-three-js-31a5569291ef"
						>
							https://medium.com/@bluemagnificent/collision-detection-in-javascript-3d-physics-using-ammo-js-and-three-js-31a5569291ef
						</a>
						. As collision detection is a big subject in ammo.js we will only be
						covering the basics for this tutorial.
					</strong></p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/collision detection.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Getting started</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Before we start programming these concepts you need to first set up
							your workspace to do this you will need to install ammo.js and three.js
							from this link: when you are done that you can create a folder with
							whatever project name you want and inside that folder create an index
							file and a js folder containing both the ammo.js/ three.js files, for a
							more in-depth tutorial on setting up your workspace you can use this
							link:
						</strong>
						<a
							target="_blank"
							href="https://github.com/mattr862/Ammo.js-Three.js/blob/master/Setting%20up%20ammo.js%20Three.js.pdf"
						>
							<strong>
								https://github.com/mattr862/Ammo.js-Three.js/blob/master/Setting%20up%20ammo.js%20Three.js.pdf
							</strong>
						</a>
						<strong>.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Now that you have set up your folder you will need to also have an IDE
							that supports javascript and HTML if you do not have this already I
							suggest you install visual studio code which is what will be used
							during this how-to guide:
						</strong>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">
							<strong>https://code.visualstudio.com/download</strong>
						</a>
						<strong>.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Now you are ready to start programming, with your index.html file open
							in the ide you should now do the “! Tab” shortcut at the top of the
							document to auto-create your HTML page. Now you will want to import the
							libraries you will be using for this body by using the script tag in
							body and src from the root of the folder to “js/ammo.js” and
							“js/three.js” and create another script tag that will contain your
							JavaScript code for this tutorial.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Your code should look like this:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;head&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
						initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;title&gt;Setting up world&lt;/title&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;/head&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;body&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;script src="js/three.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;script src="js/ammo.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;script&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;/script&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;/body&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
						&lt;/html&gt;
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong>
							In your script tag, you will also want to create an Init function (
							init short for initiate ) which will contain all the main function
							calls and enter the statement Ammo().then( Init ); which will initiate
							ammo.
						</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						After this you need to declare the global variables for the program, so at
						the top of the script we we enter the following code:
					</p>
					<p>
						//variable declaration
					</p>
					<p>
						let physicsWorld, controls, scene, camera, renderer; //three.js variables
					</p>
					<p>
						let rigidBodies = []; // ammo.js variables
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong> </strong>
					</h3>
					<h3>
						<strong><u>Declaring variables and setting up graphics</u></strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Before creating the physics world, we need to first create the graphics
							by creating a world three.js which will be what you see on the browser,
							To do this we define a setUpGraphics function which instantiates the
							three main attributes for our three.js world: "the camera, renderer,
							and scene". We will define all these attributes at the beginning of the
							script which the world will be based on so their values can be accessed
							globally. There are many other attributes you can add like lighting and
							so on but we will not be covering these in this tutorial. In this
							function, we will instantiate also a clock attribute which will be used
							later when we begin working with ammo.js.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						function setupGraphics()
					</p>
					<p>
						{
					</p>
					<p>
						//create clock for timing
					</p>
					<p>
						clock = new THREE.Clock();
					</p>
					<p>
						//create the scene
					</p>
					<p>
						scene = new THREE.Scene();
					</p>
					<p>
						scene.background = new THREE.Color( 0xbfd1e5 );
					</p>
					<p>
						//create camera
					</p>
					<p>
						camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 17, window.innerWidth /
						window.innerHeight, 0.2, 5000 );
					</p>
					<p>
						camera.position.set( 50, 180, -170 );
					</p>
					<p>
						camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
					</p>
					<p>
						//Add hemisphere light
					</p>
					<p>
						let hemiLight = new THREE.HemisphereLight( 0xffffff, 0xffffff, 0.1 );
					</p>
					<p>
						hemiLight.color.setHSL( 0.6, 0.6, 0.6 );
					</p>
					<p>
						hemiLight.groundColor.setHSL( 0.1, 1, 0.4 );
					</p>
					<p>
						hemiLight.position.set( 0, 50, 0 );
					</p>
					<p>
						scene.add( hemiLight );
					</p>
					<p>
						//Add directional light
					</p>
					<p>
						let dirLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff , 1);
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.color.setHSL( 0.1, 1, 0.95 );
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.position.set( -1, 1.75, 1 );
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.position.multiplyScalar( 100 );
					</p>
					<p>
						scene.add( dirLight );
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.castShadow = true;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 2048;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 2048;
					</p>
					<p>
						let d = 50;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.camera.left = -d;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.camera.right = d;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.camera.top = d;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.camera.bottom = -d;
					</p>
					<p>
						dirLight.shadow.camera.far = 13500;
					</p>
					<p>
						//Setup the renderer
					</p>
					<p>
						renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer( { antialias: true } );
					</p>
					<p>
						renderer.setClearColor( 0xbfd1e5 );
					</p>
					<p>
						renderer.setPixelRatio( window.devicePixelRatio );
					</p>
					<p>
						renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
					</p>
					<p>
						document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );
					</p>
					<p>
						renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
					</p>
					<p>
						}
					</p>
					<h3>
						<br/>
					</h3>
					<h3>
						<strong><u>Creating the Physics world</u></strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Now we create the physics world using Ammo.js. This is a separate world
							from the three.js world which has physics properties and will be the
							basis for what the objects we create in the three.js world is going to
							be doing in each frame.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						function setupPhysicsWorld()
					</p>
					<p>
						{
					</p>
					<p>
						let collisionConfiguration = new Ammo.btDefaultCollisionConfiguration(),
					</p>
					<p>
						dispatcher = new Ammo.btCollisionDispatcher(collisionConfiguration),
					</p>
					<p>
						overlappingPairCache = new Ammo.btDbvtBroadphase(),
					</p>
					<p>
						solver = new Ammo.btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver();
					</p>
					<p>
						physicsWorld = new Ammo.btDiscreteDynamicsWorld(dispatcher,
						overlappingPairCache, solver, collisionConfiguration);
					</p>
					<p>
						physicsWorld.setGravity(new Ammo.btVector3(0, -10, 0));
					</p>
					<p>
						}
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong><u>Creating the render function</u></strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>
							The next step is creating a render frame function, this function will
							create a render loop which for every frame the scene and camera are
							updated. However, you may notice that we only use the renderer in this
							loop meaning that we only render the three.js world without considering
							the ammo.js world. This is because at the minute there is no need to
							add physics to the three.js world. After all, there are currently no
							objects to apply physics to. We will cover this in the creating bodies
							part of this tutorial.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						function renderFrame()
					</p>
					<p>
						{
					</p>
					<p>
						renderer.render( scene, camera );
					</p>
					<p>
						requestAnimationFrame( renderFrame );
					</p>
					<p>
						}
					</p>
					<h3>
						<strong><u>Function calls</u></strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Now in the init function created earlier you should invoke all the
							functions we have created so far so that the program works.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						function Init()
					</p>
					<p>
						{
					</p>
					<p>
						//code goes here
					</p>
					<p>
						setupPhysicsWorld();
					</p>
					<p>
						setupGraphics();
					</p>
					<p>
						renderFrame();
					</p>
					<p>
						}
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Now if you open the live server in vs code you should see just a blue
							screen this is good it means your code is working right now. The reason
							that there is nothing in it is that we have not added anything but the
							physics and the graphics world itself. If you don’t get a blue screen
							at this point like the image below there is an issue and you should go
							back and check your code.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/blue screen.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Rigid bodies</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Static rigid body</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							The first body we are going to create is a static rigid body we do this
							by creating both a cube in ammo.js and three.js with a long x and
							z-axis and short y-axis( x represents the width of the object, z
							represents length and y represents height, these three values x,y,z are
							known as vector3 in programming and can be used to set the position of
							an object, size, and rotation) and a mass of 0, this mass of 0 will
							make the body static. This will create the world in which your program
							will be based.
						</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						function createBlock()
					</p>
					<p>
						{
					</p>
					<p>
						let pos = {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0};
					</p>
					<p>
						let scale = {x: 50, y: 2, z: 50};
					</p>
					<p>
						let quat = {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w: 1};
					</p>
					<p>
						let mass = 0;
					</p>
					<p>
						//threeJS Section
					</p>
					<p>            let blockPlane = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(), new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({color: 0x3c4145}));

						blockPlane.position.set(pos.x, pos.y, pos.z);
						blockPlane.scale.set(scale.x, scale.y, scale.z);
			
						blockPlane.castShadow = true;
						blockPlane.receiveShadow = true;
			
						scene.add(blockPlane);
			
						//Ammojs Section
						let transform = new Ammo.btTransform();
						transform.setIdentity();
						transform.setOrigin( new Ammo.btVector3( pos.x, pos.y, pos.z ) );
						transform.setRotation( new Ammo.btQuaternion( quat.x, quat.y, quat.z, quat.w ) );
						let motionState = new Ammo.btDefaultMotionState( transform );
			
						let colShape = new Ammo.btBoxShape( new Ammo.btVector3( scale.x * 0.5, scale.y * 0.5, scale.z * 0.5 ) );
						colShape.setMargin( 0.05 );
			
						let localInertia = new Ammo.btVector3( 0, 0, 0 );
						colShape.calculateLocalInertia( mass, localInertia );
			
						let rbInfo = new Ammo.btRigidBodyConstructionInfo( mass, motionState, colShape, localInertia );

						physicsWorld.addRigidBody( body, colGroupPlane, colGroupPlankBlocks );
						
					}
					</p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/static rigid body image.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
					<p>
						<strong><u>Dynamic rigid body</u></strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							Now we are going to create a dynamic rigid body, this type of body is
							created similarly to how a static rigid body is creating the main
							difference is that it has mass to physics can be applied to it, and as
							well as this we add is to our rigid Bodies array that we defined
							earlier this is so we can use this array later so we can update the
							positions correlating three.js objects of the ammo.js bodies so that we
							can see the effects of the physics world in the browser for this
							example we are creating a sphere object instead of a cube object that
							we used in for making
						</strong>
